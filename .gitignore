# 1. IGNORE EVERYTHING
# This pattern matches all files in the current and subdirectories.
*

# 2. ALLOW DIRECTORY TRAVERSAL
# This is the crucial step: un-ignore all subdirectories so Git can
# look inside them for whitelisted files.
!*/

# 3. WHITELIST CORE PROJECT FILES/FOLDERS

# Keep the .gitignore file itself
!.gitignore

# Whitelist the essential files inside this directory:
!index.html
!README.md
!styles.css


# Whitelist the 'images' folder and its contents recursively:
!/assets/
!/assets/images/
/assets/images/*
!/assets/images/avatar-jessica.jpeg


# 4. RE-IGNORE DESIGN/STYLE FOLDERS
# Since we unignored all directories globally with '!*/', we must
# re-ignore the specific directories we DON'T want tracked.
